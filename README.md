# RE-Bounce

This is a little toy app that "simulates" bouncy balls. It uses [Reprocessing](https://github.com/schmavery/reprocessing), and is based off of [Benjamin San Souci](https://github.com/bsansouci)'s [Reprocessing Example Repo](https://github.com/bsansouci/reprocessing-example).

## Run

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```
